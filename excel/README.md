# Excel Sales Analysis Project

This repository showcases my **Excel Data Analysis Project** where I performed data cleaning, created interactive dashboards, and conducted various analyses. The goal of this project was to analyze sales data, uncover key insights, and present them in an accessible way using Excel's powerful tools.

## Key Activities:
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Handled missing data, inconsistent formats, and duplicate entries.
  - Removed extra rows and columns that were irrelevant to the analysis.
  
- **Data Transformation**:
  - Converted raw sales data into an **Excel Table** to enable dynamic analysis.
  - Used **XLOOKUP** to efficiently pull related information from different tables.

- **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts**:
  - Built **Pivot Tables** to summarize sales data by different categories (e.g., Region, Product, Month).
  - Created **Pivot Charts** to visualize trends in sales across different products, regions and time.

- **Interactive Dashboards**:
  - Designed an **interactive dashboard** using **slicers** to allow users to filter data by different dimensions (e.g., Region, Product).
  - Highlighted key performance indicators (KPIs) to track important metrics, such as total sales, average sales by region, and highest sale.

- **Conditional Formatting**:
  - Applied **conditional formatting** to highlight sales values greater than $400, helping to quickly identify high-performing sales.

## Tools & Techniques Used:
- **Excel** (PivotTables, PivotCharts, Conditional Formatting, XLOOKUP, Data Cleanup)
- **Data Analysis** (Sales Analysis, KPIs, Trend Analysis)

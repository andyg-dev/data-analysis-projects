# SQL Queries Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio demonstrates my ability to perform various SQL operations using the **WSDA_Music.db** dataset. It includes examples of my work with:
- Data retrieval
- Filtering and aggregation
- Joining tables
- Data transformations
- Performance optimizations

## Skills Demonstrated
Here are the key SQL operations I have applied:
- **Basic Queries**: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- **Advanced Aggregation**: `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`
- **Joins**: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`
- **Window Functions**: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LEAD()`
- **Subqueries & CTEs**: Working with nested queries
- **Data Transformation**: `CASE`, `TRIM()`, `CAST()`, `SUBSTRING()`
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexing, Query Optimization

## Files Included
- **WSDA_Music.db**: SQLite database with music-related data.
- **.sql Files**: SQL query files demonstrating different techniques:
  - `1_Select_Operations.sql`: Basic SELECT queries.
  - `2_Advanced_Aggregation.sql`: Using GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions.
  - `3_Join_Operations.sql`: Inner, outer, and self joins.
  - `4_Time_Series_Analysis.sql`: Analyzing trends over time.

## Projects/Case Studies
### 1. **Music Sales Analysis**
**Problem**: Identify top-selling albums over the past five years.
**Solution**: Applied `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to summarize album sales and identify top performers.

### 2. **Customer Retention Analysis**
**Problem**: Identify users who churned based on listening behavior.
**Solution**: Used `SUBQUERY` and `JOIN` to compare historical and recent user data.

### 3. **Trend Analysis**
**Problem**: Track seasonal trends in song popularity.
**Solution**: Implemented window functions like `RANK()` to identify top songs per month.

## Conclusion
This portfolio highlights my proficiency with SQL operations, data analysis, and optimization. It demonstrates the ability to solve business problems using SQL and provide actionable insights.

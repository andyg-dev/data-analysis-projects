# **SQL Query Operations Portfolio**

Welcome to my **SQL Queries Portfolio**! This repository contains examples of various SQL operations I've learned and practiced. Each query demonstrates a different SQL technique, such as filtering, aggregating, and manipulating data, as well as joining multiple tables.

### **SQL Operations Included:**
1. **SELECT**: Retrieve data from a database.
2. **FROM**: Specify the table to retrieve data from.
3. **HAVING**: Filter results after performing aggregation (e.g., `GROUP BY`).
4. **ADD**: Inserting new data into a table (`INSERT`).
5. **UPDATE**: Modifying existing data in a table.
6. **DELETE**: Removing data from a table.
7. **ORDER BY**: Sorting query results based on one or more columns.
8. **LIMIT**: Limiting the number of rows returned in a query.
9. **JOIN**: Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
10. **GROUP BY**: Grouping rows that have the same values into summary rows.
11. **AVG**: Calculating the average of a numeric column.
12. **SUBQUERY**: Using a query within another query.

# **SQL Query Operations Portfolio**

Welcome to my **SQL Queries Portfolio**! This repository contains examples of various SQL operations I've learned and practiced. Each query demonstrates a different SQL technique, such as filtering, aggregating, and manipulating data, as well as joining multiple tables.

### **SQL Operations Included:**
1. **SELECT**: Retrieve data from a database.
2. **FROM**: Specify the table to retrieve data from.
3. **HAVING**: Filter results after performing aggregation (e.g., `GROUP BY`).
4. **ADD**: Inserting new data into a table (`INSERT`).
5. **UPDATE**: Modifying existing data in a table.
6. **DELETE**: Removing data from a table.
7. **ORDER BY**: Sorting query results based on one or more columns.
8. **LIMIT**: Limiting the number of rows returned in a query.
9. **JOIN**: Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
10. **GROUP BY**: Grouping rows that have the same values into summary rows.
11. **AVG**: Calculating the average of a numeric column.
12. **SUBQUERY**: Using a query within another query.

## Files Included

- **WSDA_Music.db**: The SQLite database file containing music-related data.
- **.sql files**: A series of SQL query files demonstrating different SQL operations. These files contain the SQL code used for various analyses and operations on the `WSDA_Music.db` database.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the **WSDA_Music.db** file with a database browser or SQLite client (e.g., [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)).
3. Execute the `.sql` files in any SQL editor or directly inside an SQLite client to see the queries in action.
   - Each `.sql` file contains a specific SQL operation or analysis, and they are organized based on the type of operation (e.g., `add_update_delete_artist_data.sql`, `group_by_avg_spending.sql`).

## Conclusion

This project showcases various SQL operations and query techniques applied to a music database. It highlights my ability to manipulate and analyze relational data using SQL.

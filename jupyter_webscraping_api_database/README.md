# Iowa Liquor Sales Data API Project

## Overview
As part of my Data Analyst portfolio, I developed a Python-based solution to interact with the **Iowa Liquor Sales Data API**, enabling the extraction, cleaning, and analysis of large datasets. This project demonstrates my skills in **data extraction**, **data cleaning**, and **preparation**, showcasing my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights. The resulting dataset is prepared for business intelligence tools and can be used for detailed analysis and reporting.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **API Integration**: Proficiency in calling and handling data from RESTful APIs using Python's `requests` library.
- **Data Processing**: Utilized `Pandas` to clean, transform, and prepare large datasets for analysis.
- **Problem-Solving**: Cleaned data by addressing missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and standardizing key metrics.
- **Automation**: Built a script that automates the entire data extraction and cleaning process, ensuring it can be easily updated with new data.
- **Data Export**: The cleaned data is exported into a CSV file, making it ready for analysis in tools like Excel, Power BI, or Tableau.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language used for the project to interact with the API and process the data.
- **Pandas**: For advanced data manipulation and cleaning, transforming raw API data into a structured format.
- **Requests**: To make API calls and retrieve the raw data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development, analysis, and testing of the code.

## Why This Project is Valuable to Employers
- **Business Problem Solving**: This project directly addresses how to clean and prepare complex datasets from external APIs, a key skill for roles focused on data preparation, analysis, and reporting.
- **End-to-End Workflow**: From data extraction through to clean and structured datasets, this demonstrates the ability to manage data pipelines and transform unorganized data into valuable, actionable insights.
- **Scalability**: The script can easily be adapted to handle other APIs, making it a versatile solution for extracting and analyzing various datasets in a business context.
- **Data Integrity**: A key focus was on cleaning the data to ensure it is accurate and free of inconsistencies, which is crucial for high-quality business analysis.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Extraction**: The project starts by making a simple API call to fetch data from the Iowa Liquor Sales API.
2. **Data Cleaning**: I use `Pandas` to:
   - Handle missing data.
   - Drop irrelevant columns.
   - Format key metrics for further analysis.
3. **Data Export**: After cleaning the data, it is saved in a CSV format, making it ready for analysis in any reporting tool like Excel or Power BI.

# Web Scraping Quotes from "Quotes to Scrape" using Python

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates web scraping techniques using Python. The goal is to scrape quotes, authors, and associated tags from the website "Quotes to Scrape" using `BeautifulSoup` and `Requests`.

The script retrieves the HTML content from the webpage, parses the quotes, authors, and tags, and then stores and prints them in a structured format.

## Features

- **Scrapes** quotes, authors, and tags from the website.
- **Uses** `requests` to fetch the webpage content.
- **Parses** the HTML using `BeautifulSoup` to extract relevant data.
- **Displays** the data in a clean, readable format.

# Sales Trends Analysis: Inventory and Staffing needs

## Purpose
This analysis uses historical sales data to identify peak demand periods, helping inform decisions around inventory and staffing needs. Given the company's reliance on tourism, accurately forecasting high-demand months is critical to optimizing resources and maximizing profitability.

## Business Question
When should the company increase staffing and inventory levels to meet seasonal demand?

## Approach
A line chart was created in Microsoft Excel using total sales data from the past three years. The chart visually represents monthly sales trends, allowing for quick identification of recurring peak periods.

## Findings
The line chart clearly shows that December through February consistently experience the highest sales volumes. These months align with peak tourist season, confirming that demand spikes during this period each year.

## Recommendation
Based on the chart analysis:
- Increase inventory and staffing during December, January, and February.
- Use this seasonal pattern to guide future operational planning and resource allocation.

## Using Excel charts for this analysis delivers a fast, effective way to translate historical data into actionable business insights.

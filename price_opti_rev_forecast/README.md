# E-commerce Price Optimization and Revenue Forecasting
This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce sales data, employing various data science techniques to gain insights into customer behavior, optimize pricing strategies, and forecast future revenue. The analysis covers data loading and cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis with outlier handling and visualization, pricing optimization using polynomial regression, and time series forecasting using the Prophet library.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Data Loading and Cleaning: Reading data from a CSV file, handling missing values, and filtering invalid records.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features ('Revenue', 'Month', 'Year') from existing data to enrich the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarizing data characteristics, identifying and handling outliers using quantile-based filtering, and visualizing data distributions and trends over time.
- Data Visualization: Utilizing matplotlib to create histograms for exploring data distributions and line plots for visualizing time-series trends.
- Statistical Analysis: Applying descriptive statistics (describe()) to understand data characteristics and using quantile analysis for outlier detection.
- Regression Analysis (Pricing Optimization): Implementing polynomial regression using sklearn to model the relationship between unit price and quantity sold, and using this model to predict sales volume across a range of prices.
- Time Series Forecasting: Employing the Prophet library to model and forecast future revenue based on historical sales data, including the generation of confidence intervals for forecasts.
- Data Manipulation: Using pandas for data manipulation, aggregation (groupby().sum()), and transformation.
- Machine Learning Fundamentals: Applying supervised learning (regression) and time series modeling techniques.

## Project Structure:
main.py: Contains the Python code for data analysis and forecasting.
data.csv: The input file containing the e-commerce sales data.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Results and Visualizations:
The script generates several plots that are crucial for understanding the analysis:

- Distribution of UnitPrice and Quantity: Histograms showing the frequency distribution of product prices and quantities sold after outlier removal.
- Monthly Revenue Over Time: A line plot illustrating the trend of total revenue aggregated by month and year.
- Price Optimization: Impact of Price on Sales Volume: A scatter plot of actual sales data overlaid with the predicted sales volume based on the polynomial regression model, including a confidence interval for the predictions.
- Revenue Forecast for Next Year: A line plot showing the forecasted revenue for the next 12 months, along with a confidence interval.
- These visualizations help in identifying patterns, understanding the relationship between price and sales, and visualizing future revenue projections.

## Potential Future Improvements:
- More sophisticated outlier detection and handling methods: Explore techniques beyond quantile filtering
- Advanced feature engineering: Create more features, such as customer lifetime value, product categories, or seasonality indicators.
- Different regression models for pricing: Experiment with other models like non-linear regression or machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluation of forecasting model performance: Implement metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the Prophet model.
- Incorporation of external factors: Consider including external data like holidays, promotional events, or economic indicators to improve forecasting accuracy.
- Customer segmentation: Analyze different customer segments and their impact on sales and pricing strategies.
- Interactive visualizations: Use libraries like Plotly or Bokeh to create interactive plots.

# Azure, Snowflake, SQL Server ETL & AI Sentiment Analysis Pipeline
This project demonstrates a strong understanding of **full end-to-end data pipeline**. Using Python (pandas), Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL database, Azure Data Studio, Azure Co-Pilot, Azure AI Text Analytics and Snowflake, this project analyzes customer feedback and bins negative, neutral, positive feedback. This prcoess helps **tech startups** with insights into **customer service rep performance**.

## Pipeline Overview
Data Extraction & Cleaning:

- Structured customer feedback data is extracted from various sources.

- A Python script cleans and preprocesses this data.

- The cleaned data is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL Server through Data Studio.

Sentiment Analysis:

- Azure AI Language service analyzes the sentiment of the feedback (positive, negative, neutral).

- Data Loading into Snowflake.

- The processed data is staged in Azure Blob Storage.

- Integrate Snowflake with Azure Blob Storage to load data into Snowflake

- A Snowflake view is created to summarize agent sentiment performance metrics.

## Pipeline Overview
Data Extraction & Cleaning:

- Structured customer feedback data is extracted from various sources.

- A Python script cleans and preprocesses this data.

- The cleaned data is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.

Sentiment Analysis:

- Azure AI Language service analyzes the sentiment of the feedback (positive, negative, neutral).

- Data Loading into Snowflake:

- The processed data is staged in Azure Blob Storage.

- Using Azure Data Factory, data is loaded into Snowflake.

- A Snowflake view is created to summarize agent sentiment performance metrics.

# Data Analysis Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Projects Portfolio**! This repository contains a collection of various data analysis projects I’ve worked on using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**. Each folder represents a different tool I’ve used to explore, analyze, and visualize data across various domains.

## Table of Contents

- [SQL Projects](#sql-projects)
- [Excel Projects](#excel-projects)
- [Power BI Projects](#power-bi-projects)

## SQL Projects

In this folder, you'll find a series of SQL queries and operations I’ve implemented to analyze and manipulate data using relational databases.

### Key Operations Demonstrated:
- **SELECT**: Retrieving data from tables
- **JOIN**: Combining data from multiple tables
- **GROUP BY & HAVING**: Aggregating and filtering data
- **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE**: Modifying data in the database
- **Subqueries**: Using nested queries for complex analysis
- **Window Functions**: Advanced analysis on a dataset

### Files in this Folder:
- `wsd_music.db`: An SQLite database containing music-related data.
- `.sql files`: A series of SQL query files demonstrating various operations on the `wsd_music.db` database.

### Key Techniques Demonstrated:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data and correcting inconsistencies.
- **Pivot Tables & Charts**: Summarizing and visualizing data dynamically.
- **XLOOKUP & INDEX/MATCH**: Extracting related data from multiple tables.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Highlighting important trends and insights.

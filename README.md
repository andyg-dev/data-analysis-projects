## ⭐ Highlighted Projects

### 1. **CharterUP Analytics: Cancellations & Customer Segmentation**
- Analyzed **operational performance** and **customer behavior** for a **tech startup** using SQL queries, Python scripts, and Tableau visualizations. Applied statistical analysis (chi-square analysis and K-means clustering) to examine booking cancellations, recommending alternative investigative routes. Developed segmented strategies tailored to different customer groups to enhance service optimization and revenue growth.

### 2. **Sales Analysis - Excel**
- Leveraged PivotTables, PivotCharts, and **KPIs** to produce a dashboard for a food company that tracked revenue trends, identified high-performing regions, and optimized inventory based on top-selling products. 

### 3. **Sales Dashboard with Snowflake & Power BI**
- Built an end to end **ETL pipeline** using Azure, Snowflake, and Python to extract, clean, and analyze customer feedback. It integrates AI-powered sentiment analysis via Azure AI Language to categorize feedback as positive, neutral, or negative, helping businesses assess their **customer representative performance**. The cleaned and processed data is then stored in Azure Blob Storage and loaded into Snowflake, where a structured view summarizes sentiment trends. These insights enable companies to **optimize customer service, refine training programs,** and improve overall **operational efficiency.**

### 4. **E-Commerce Price Optimization and Revenue Forecasting**
- Used *statistical analysis* (regression and predictive modeling) for an e-commerce company to identify optimal price points as well as forecast revenue over the next 12 months, enabling data-driven decisions in **inventory planning, marketing spend, and sales strategy.**

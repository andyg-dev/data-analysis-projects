# Data Analysis Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Projects Portfolio**! This repository contains a collection of various data analysis projects I’ve worked on using **SQL**, **Excel**, **Power BI**, **Python**, **Google Looker Studio**, **APIs**, **Web scraping**. Each folder represents a different tool I’ve used to explore, analyze, and visualize data across various domains.

## SQL Project

In this folder, you'll find a series of SQL queries and operations I’ve implemented to analyze and manipulate data using relational databases.

### Key Operations Demonstrated:
- **SELECT**: Retrieving data from tables
- **JOIN**: Combining data from multiple tables
- **GROUP BY & HAVING**: Aggregating and filtering data
- **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE**: Modifying data in the database
- **Subqueries**: Using nested queries for complex analysis
- **Window Functions**: Advanced analysis on a dataset

### Files in this Folder:
- `wsd_music.db`: An SQLite database containing music-related data.
- `.sql files`: A series of SQL query files demonstrating various operations on the `wsd_music.db` database.

## Excel Project

This folder contains data analysis projects using **Excel**, where I applied a range of techniques including data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboards.

### Key Techniques Demonstrated:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data and correcting inconsistencies.
- **Pivot Tables & Charts**: Summarizing and visualizing data dynamically.
- **XLOOKUP & INDEX/MATCH**: Extracting related data from multiple tables.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Highlighting important trends and insights.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Creating slicers and KPIs for better visualization.

### Files in this Folder:
- `sales_data.xlsx`: A sample dataset used for sales analysis.
- `dashboard.xlsx`: An interactive Excel dashboard with key performance metrics.

## Power BI Project

This folder features Power BI projects where I created interactive dashboards, data models, and visualizations to analyze business performance.

### Key Features Demonstrated:
- **Power Query & Data Transformation**: Importing, cleaning, and transforming data using Power Query.
- **DAX Calculations**: Creating measures and calculated columns to analyze data.
- **Data Modeling**: Designing star schemas, relationships, and hierarchies.
- **Visualizations**: Building interactive dashboards with bar charts, KPIs, and slicers.
- **Publishing**: Sharing reports via Power BI Service for collaboration.

### Files in this Folder:
- `AdventureWorks.pbix`: A Power BI file featuring sales analysis for the fictional "Adventure Works" company.

## Jupyter Webscraping API Database Projects 

### Web Scraping Quotes from "Quotes to Scrape" using Python

This project demonstrates web scraping techniques using Python. The goal is to scrape quotes, authors, and associated tags from the website "Quotes to Scrape" using BeautifulSoup and Requests. The script retrieves the HTML content from the webpage, parses the quotes, authors, and tags, and then stores and prints them in a structured format.

### Key Features Demonstrated:

- Python (Requests, BeautifulSoup)
- Scrapes quotes, authors, and tags from the website.
- Uses requests to fetch the webpage content.
- Parses the HTML using BeautifulSoup to extract relevant data.
- Displays the data in a clean, readable format.

### Iowa Liquor Sales Data API Project

In this project, I developed a Python-based solution to interact with the Iowa Liquor Sales Data API, enabling the extraction, cleaning, and analysis of large datasets. The goal was to extract and process alcohol sales data and prepare it for business intelligence analysis.

### Key Features Demonstrated:

- Python (Requests, Pandas)

- Jupyter Notebooks

- API integration for extracting real-time liquor sales data from the Iowa Liquor Sales API.

- Data cleaning using Pandas, handling missing values and formatting key metrics.

- Automates data extraction and cleaning, exporting cleaned data to a CSV file for analysis.

## Combined Excel Python PowerBI Project

This project analyzes productivity trends based on time-tracked data collected over 18 days in 2023. The data is recorded in small time blocks, and the goal is to clean, categorize, and visualize this data for actionable insights.

### Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas)**: For data cleaning, transformation, and categorization.
- **Excel (Power Query)**: For initial data transformation and cleanup.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive reports and dashboards.

### Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned 1,000 rows of data, standardized date-time formats, and depersonalized sensitive information.
- **Activity Categorization**: Used Python scripts to categorize activities based on keywords and merged the results with the dataset.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Created bar charts and line graphs to track productivity trends, with custom measures and interactive filters.

### Conclusion
This project integrates Python and Power BI to provide insightful visualizations of productivity trends, helping to optimize tracking and resource allocation.

## Project Objective

The goal of these projects is to demonstrate my ability to analyze and visualize data using various tools and techniques. Through these projects, I have gained experience in transforming raw data into actionable insights, building reports, and making data-driven decisions.
